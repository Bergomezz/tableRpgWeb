# Table RPG Web Application

## Introduction

Welcome to our project! This is a web application designed to assist players and Dungeon Masters of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) in organizing their games.<br> Our goal is to provide a comprehensive platform where users can manage characters, monsters, objectives, items, and maps to enrich their storytelling experience.<br><br>

Our application leverages the structure of D&D games to provide interactive and animated character sheets for players.<br> For Dungeon Masters, we offer detailed views of created characters, a library of monsters that can be added to the game, a catalog of items, and tools for organizing quests to include in their campaigns.<br><br>

Please note that this project is currently under construction and we do not yet have an estimated completion date. We appreciate your interest and invite you to check back for updates as we continue to develop this exciting tool for the D&D community.<br><br>
